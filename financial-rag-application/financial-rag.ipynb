      "The People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) and India regulate Amazon’s and its affiliates’ businesses and operations in country through regulations and licenserequirements that may restrict (i) foreign investment in and operation of the internet, IT infrastructure, data centers, retail, delivery, and other sectors, (ii) internetcontent, and (iii) the sale of media and other products and services. For example, in order to meet local ownership, regulatory licensing, and cybersecurityrequirements, we provide certain technology services in China through contractual relationships with third parties that hold PRC licenses to provide services. InIndia, the government restricts the ownership or control of Indian companies by foreign entities involved in online multi-brand retail trading activities. Forwww.amazon.in, we provide certain marketing tools and logistics services to third-party sellers to enable them to sell online and deliver to customers, and we holdan indirect minority interest in an entity that is a third-party seller on the www.amazon.in marketplace. Although we believe these structures and activities complywith existing laws, they involve unique risks, and the PRC and India may from time to time consider and implement additional changes in their regulatory, licensing,or other requirements that could impact these structures and activities. There are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation of PRC and Indian laws andregulations, and it is possible that these governments will ultimately take a view contrary to ours. In addition, our Chinese and Indian businesses and operations maybe unable to continue to operate if we or our affiliates are unable to access sufficient funding or, in China, enforce contractual relationships we or our affiliates havein place. Violation of any existing or future PRC, Indian, or other laws or regulations or changes in the interpretations of those laws and regulations could result inour businesses in those countries being subject to fines and other financial penalties, having licenses revoked, or being forced to restructure our operations or shutdown entirely.\n",
