# 7-Day Challenge: Building LLM Applications

This repository contains notes, assignments, and projects for the AI Camp 7-Day LLM challenge lead by Candice You. The challenge can be found here: https://www.aicamp.ai/event/eventdetails/W2025010600 


## LLM Application: AI Financial Advisor  

For the project component of the course, we present an AI Financial Advisor. It is a RAG system that gives financial information and advice 
about companies based on information retrieved from SEC filings.  

For details, see `financial-rag-application/financial-rag.ipynb`
